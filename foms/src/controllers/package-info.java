/**
 * The controllers package contains classes responsible for managing the user interface.
 * Controllers play a crucial role in the application's architecture by facilitating the interaction
 * between the user and the underlying system. They handle user input, process it, and coordinate
 * the flow of data between the user interface, service layer, and view components.
 * 
 * <p>The responsibilities of controllers include:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>Receiving user input.</li>
 *     <li>Performing basic validation and preprocessing of user input to ensure its correctness and consistency.</li>
 *     <li>Delegating the processed input to the appropriate service classes for further business logic execution.</li>
 *     <li>Receiving the results from the service classes and coordinating the presentation of data to the user interface.</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <p>Controllers act as intermediaries, decoupling the user interface from the underlying business logic
 * to promote modularity, maintainability, and testability of the application.
